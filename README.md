In this project I will be making a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

The reason I'll be doing this is to practice DOM manipulation, Flexbox and to create something interesting using my knowledge.

This project consists of a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs, the squares change color based on the mouse hover.

You can make a new grid by clicking on the 'Resize' button on the top of the screen.
